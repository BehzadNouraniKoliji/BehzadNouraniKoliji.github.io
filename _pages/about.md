My research lies at the intersection of Signal Processing and Reinforcement Learning. I am finishing my PhD under the supervision of ... . 

I posses two master's degrees. 
For my master's degree, I gratuated from Sapienza University of Rome, department of [Computer, Control, and Management Engineering](https://www.diag.uniroma1.it/en) where I received my degree in [Engineering in Computer Science](https://www.diag.uniroma1.it/en/courses). 

Before my second master's degree, I worked for 3+ years as a data analyst in [ABARA](https://abaraco.com/en/). 


Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
