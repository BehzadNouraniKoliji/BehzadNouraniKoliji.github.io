My research lies at the intersection of Signal Processing and Reinforcement Learning. 
I am finishing my PhD under the supervision of [Claire Vernade](https://www.cvernade.com/). 
My research is focused on bandit algorithms on graphs, multi-agent and network systems.

I received my 2nd master's degree in [Engineering in Computer Science](https://www.diag.uniroma1.it/en/courses) in 2020. 
I gratuated from Sapienza University of Rome, department of [Computer, Control, and Management Engineering](https://www.diag.uniroma1.it/en). 
During my studies, I directly worked with [Sergio Barbarossa](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2woHFu8AAAAJ&hl=en) on 
mutliple projects related to Multi-Variate Time Series Models, Causal Structures, Graph Structure Learning from Streaming Data, Time-Varying Graphs, Regularization, and Optimization. 

My resume includes 3+ years of working as a data analyst in industry. 
In addition, I have worked for another 3+ years as research engineer on projects focused on Feature Engineering in Face Recognition Systems
as well as Cancer Detection in Mammogram Images. 

Recently, I have started working on AutoML for Tabular Foundation Models. 

<!--
In my projects, you can find my hands-on skills in a wide range of projects in using Machine Learning and Signal Processing 
for solving real-world problems in addition to interesting visualizations. 

In my publications, you can find my skill in deep understanding + analysis + design of state-of-the-art in, problem solving, algorithm design and analysis, statistical inference, probabilistic modeling ...

<!-- Prior to my studies at the university of Rome, I worked for 3+ years as a data analyst in [ABARA](https://abaraco.com/en/). 

I received my bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from [Urmia University](https://en.urmia.ac.ir/) in 2011 and my first master's degree in Signal Processing from Azad University in 2014. During both my bachelor degree and my first master degree, I worked with [Mehdi Chehel Amirani](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=AfrSe6cAAAAJ&hl=en) on pre-processing and feature engieering of face recognition systems as well as medical images in cancer detection from mammogram images.
