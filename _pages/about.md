I have a background in Signal Processing, Machine Learning, and Reinforcement Learning. 
I finished my PhD under the supervision of [Claire Vernade](https://www.cvernade.com/team). 
I worked on Bandit Algorithms on Graphs, Multi-Agent and Network Systems where the goal is to tackle real-world problems in 
Online Recommender System design, Computational Advertising, Viral Marketing, and Resource Allocation. 

I received my master's degree in [Engineering in Computer Science](https://www.diag.uniroma1.it/en/courses) in 2020. 
I gratuated from Sapienza University of Rome, department of [Computer, Control, and Management Engineering](https://www.diag.uniroma1.it/en). 
During my stay at the University of Rome, I directly worked with [Sergio Barbarossa](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2woHFu8AAAAJ&hl=en) on 
mutliple projects related to Multi-Variate Time Series Models, Causal Structures, Graph Structure Learning from Streaming Data, Time-Varying Graphs, Regularization, and Optimization. We used frameworks for the analysis of the data of Financial Markets as well as the data of Epidemics such as Covid-19. 

My resume also includes 3+ years of working as a data analyst in industry, in Agriculture sector. 
Additionally, in another period, I worked for 3+ years as research engineer on projects focused on Feature Engineering in Face Recognition Systems as well as Cancer Detection in Mammogram Images. 

<!--

<!-- Prior to my studies at the university of Rome, I worked for 3+ years as a data analyst in [ABARA](https://abaraco.com/en/). 

I received my bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from [Urmia University](https://en.urmia.ac.ir/) in 2011 and my first master's degree in Signal Processing from Azad University in 2014. During both my bachelor degree and my first master degree, I worked with [Mehdi Chehel Amirani](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=AfrSe6cAAAAJ&hl=en) on pre-processing and feature engieering of face recognition systems as well as medical images in cancer detection from mammogram images.
