My research lies at the intersection of Signal Processing and Reinforcement Learning. I am finishing my PhD under the supervision of [Claire Vernade](https://www.cvernade.com/). 
 
I received my master's degree in [Engineering in Computer Science](https://www.diag.uniroma1.it/en/courses) in 2020. I gratuated from Sapienza University of Rome, department of [Computer, Control, and Management Engineering](https://www.diag.uniroma1.it/en). During my studies, I worked with [Sergio Barbarossa](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2woHFu8AAAAJ&hl=en) on ... 

Prior to my studies at the university of Rome, I worked for 3+ years as a data analyst in [ABARA](https://abaraco.com/en/). 

I received my bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from [Urmia University](https://en.urmia.ac.ir/) in 2011 and my first master's degree in Signal Processing from Azad University in 2014. During both my bachelor degree and my first master degree, I worked with [Mehdi Chehel Amirani](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=AfrSe6cAAAAJ&hl=en) on pre-processing and feature engieering of face recognition systems as well as medical images in cancer detection from mammogram images.
